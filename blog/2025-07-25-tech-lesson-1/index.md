The Interview That Taught Me the Hardest Lesson on Choosing the Right Tech
======================================================================================
In my 5th semester of college, I had the opportunity to interview with Morgan Stanley. As part of my project showcase, I presented an Online Examination Portal that I had built. The backend used **MongoDB**, and I was quite proud of the scalability and speed I had achieved.

The interviewer asked me a question that, in hindsight, seems simple:

> "Why did you choose MongoDB?"

I confidently replied:

> "Because it's scalable."

Then came the follow-up:

> "So SQL databases aren't scalable?"

I froze.

I scrambled to justify the decision: something about ease of implementation, fast prototyping â€” but I knew I wasnâ€™t convincing. He then asked me to write the SQL schema to store scores of students. I managed to do it.

He looked at me and said:

> "So you *could* have used SQL too. Why didnâ€™t you?"

I had no real answer. And I was disqualified.

## What I Learned â€” and Why It Mattered

That experience taught me one of the most important lessons as a developer:

> **Choosing a technology is never just about what works â€” itâ€™s about what fits the problem.**

I wasnâ€™t wrong for using MongoDB. But I didnâ€™t understand the *why* behind the decision.

## SQL vs NoSQL â€” When to Choose What

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned since â€” through reading, building, and failing:

### ðŸ§© Choose SQL When:

* **Data is relational** â€” You have structured data with defined relationships (e.g., Students â†” Courses â†” Scores)
* **Consistency matters** â€” Banking, inventory, exams: you canâ€™t afford partial or dirty writes
* **Transactions are critical** â€” SQL is ACID compliant: Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable
* **You need JOINs** â€” Perfect for pulling combined data from multiple tables
* **The schema is stable** â€” If your data model wonâ€™t change much, a rigid schema is good

ðŸ§  **Real-life example:** An HR system where employees are linked to departments, payrolls, attendance â€” all structured and interrelated.

### ðŸ“¦ Choose NoSQL When:

* **Data is flexible or unstructured** â€” JSON documents, dynamic fields, user-generated data
* **Speed and scale matter** â€” Youâ€™re writing tons of data (e.g., logs, metrics, events)
* **Relationships are minimal or unnecessary** â€” Not everything needs foreign keys
* **Youâ€™re okay with eventual consistency** â€” Real-time chat, analytics, product catalogs
* **You want faster dev cycles** â€” Great for MVPs, quick prototypes, evolving schemas

ðŸ§  **Real-life example:** A social media platform feed â€” posts, likes, comments that vary in structure and scale rapidly.

## What I Do Differently Now

Today, I ask myself:

* What is the structure of the data?
* Will the schema evolve over time?
* Do I need strong consistency or eventual is fine?
* Am I optimizing for speed, structure, or scale?

And only *then* do I choose a tool.

Since that interview, Iâ€™ve graduated â€” but I still think about that moment. It taught me more than just database theory. It taught me the value of understanding your tools, not just using them.

## Final Thought

Donâ€™t choose tech because itâ€™s trendy. Choose it because it fits.

If this story resonates, feel free to share your own. Sometimes the best lessons come from the interviews we donâ€™t clear.
